Teletext renderer
=================

This is a little Teletext Level 1.5 (ETSI ETS 300 706) renderer I threw together in my spare time.
It has been modified by TPP to export the rendered pages as images.

Installation
------------

  - Install the fonts in `~/.fonts` (symlinking may also work)
  - Install Pygame and Pillow
  - Run the scripts
